# ManyKey Firmware (Arduino/ATmega32u4)
This is project is an easy way to get a macro keyboard project going very quickly.

This is part of the [ManyKey Project](http://www.manykey.org). A cross-platform program to write to this firmware is available [here](https://github.com/ManyKeyOrg/manykey_writer).

## Features
- Supports 10+ characters pressed simultaneously per switch (this can be changed very easily if you need more)
- Supports as many buttons or switches as you have pins available
- Key configuration can be updated via USB serial
- Configuration is stored in EEPROM, so it will persist if your creation loses power

## Basic use
1. Update ```BUTTON_COUNT``` and ```buttonPins``` in the source to indicate how many and which pins you'll be using in your project.
2. Flash the sketch to your Arduino.
3. For each pin you specified, connect a switch between that pin and ground. If the pin does not support ```INPUT_PULLUP```, you'll also need to add a pull-up resistor between the pin and V+.
4. Configure the keys over serial.
5. Enjoy life with your new macro keyboard.

## Keys
You can configure regular ASCII letters/keys, as well as the modifiers [described here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/KeyboardModifiers).

## Serial protocol
For sending hex over serial, I highly recommend the freeware program [CoolTerm](https://freeware.the-meiers.org/).
